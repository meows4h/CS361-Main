        <p class="w3-left-align">Starting out, the player will be assigned either red or blue chains. The ranged players (healers, casters, and physical ranged positions) want to end up with blue chains to start and the melee players (dps and tanks) want to end up with red chains to start. To achieve this they need to swap out their chains by stepping into the center of the arena to trade out with the other mismatched players. Once this is achieved, everyone prepositions next to their orb. There are six orbs, with the melees sharing theirs and the ranged doing theirs individually. The DPS roles go West and Support roles go East. The following raid plans depict this motion.</p>

    <!-- swapping & dives -->

        <p class="w3-left-align">After the melee players share their stack at about 34 gauge on the encounter meter, they will pass off their chains to the ranged player, the '1' spots take theirs to the North players and the '2' spots take theirs to the South players. After each ranged player has their chain properly swapped to red, they can soak their individual orbs at about 40 gauge. This completes the first section, which the next part is followed by "Mirage Dives". The ranged players preposition in a box pattern around the blue eye, with DPS on the West side and the Healers on the East side. Two random players per wave with red chains are targeted for dives and need to be traded. The priority system follows as such in the diagrams below:</p>

    <!-- dives -->
    <div class="w3-center" style="width:75%; margin: 0 12.5%">
        <p class="w3-left-align">The first wave is replaced by the Tank players, with the '1' spots taking the first dive chain appearing clockwise from north and the '2' spots taking the first dive chain appearing counter-clockwise from north. This is repeated for the second group except the melee DPS now perform this instead of the tanks. For the final set of replacement dives, whoever was hit for the first wave will now go to trade out the final set of people. If the player was the first appearing clockwise, they take the first one appearing clockwise, regardless of role or spot, similarly to the first person appearing counter-clockwise. After this is successfully resolved, the encounter should be pretty easy to pass assuming there is no other mistakes!</p>

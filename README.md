# Main Program Project for DSR P4 Simulation
This is supposed to be a main program that utilizes microservices to power the information it uses and gathers.

## Current Functions
- Rough outline of main page as well as text content and basic HTML elements
- Guide and tutorial page with further resources and diagrams
- Node packages to assist with serving content from the server to the user

## Goals
- Functional use for understanding a particular puzzle from a game, in this case it is from a boss fight named 'Dragonsongs Reprise (Ultimate)' (shortened to DSR), specifically phase 4, from the game Final Fantasy XIV
- Animated and interactive, with correct corresponding visual information
- Options for practicing different versions and formats
- Fully testable and debugable
- Reuseable for recreating other fights or phases from the game or games of similar genre

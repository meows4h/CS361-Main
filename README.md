# Main Program Project for CS361
This is supposed to be a main program that utilizes microservices to power the information it uses and gathers.

## Goals
- Functional use for understanding a particular puzzle from a game, in this case it is from a boss fight named 'Dragonsongs Reprise (Ultimate)' (shortened to DSR), specifically phase 4, from the game Final Fantasy XIV
- Animated and interactive, with correct corresponding visual information
- Options for practicing different versions and formats
- Fully testable and debugable
- Reuseable for recreating other fights or phases from the game or games of similar genre
